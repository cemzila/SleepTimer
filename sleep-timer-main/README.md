# Study Timer
For our project, we created a timer which runs in a popup to use for studying. You can edit the length of it as well as pause it if needed. When the popup's closed it continues to run, so it can be closed so it doesn't take up space then checked when needed. 

## Installation
1. Download the source code using the [github page](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/study-timer)
2. Go to firefox and type about:debugging in the search bar.
3. Navigate to the "This Firefox" tab and under the temporary extensions section hit "load temporary add-on"
4. Open the folder with the study timer code and select the manifest.json file
5. You should now be able to access the timer via the clock icon to the right of the search bar!
